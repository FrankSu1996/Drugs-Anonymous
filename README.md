# Drugs-Anonymous

This project was implemented as part of a COMPSCI 2XB3 Practice and Experience course's final project. 
This software allows users to input a medical condition, and using sorting and searching algorithms, will
list all of the medication that can treat the condition based on reported user effectiveness. The software also 
lets users enter a drug name and lists all of the negative drug interactions based on the input. 

Included is a executable DrugsAnonymous.jar file. 

### NOTE: 
There is currently a bug in the software, where in order to use "Enter a sympton to find a cure for" functionality,
one must click "start search" without any input.
